# Read shooting Incident from 2006 to 2022
NYPD_Shooting_Incident_2006_2022 = 
  read_csv("data/NYPD_Shooting_Incident_Data__Historic__20231120.csv") |>
  janitor::clean_names() 

# Read shooting incident data for 2023
NYPD_Shooting_Incident_2023 = 
  read_csv("data/NYPD_Shooting_Incident_Data__Year_To_Date__20231129.csv") |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  select(-new_georeferenced_column, -statistical_murder_flag)

NYPD_Shooting_Incident_cleaned = 
  bind_rows(NYPD_Shooting_Incident_2006_2022, NYPD_Shooting_Incident_2023) |>
  separate(occur_date, into = c("month", "day", "year"), sep = "/") |>
  separate(occur_time, into = c("hour", "minute", "second"), sep = ":") |>

every_month = 
  NYPD_Shooting_Incident_cleaned |> 
  group_by(year,month) |> 
  summarize(cases_number = n())

```

First, we import the cleaned data into the environment, and grouped the data by year and month. After that, we count the case number of each month and would like to find out that is there any serial autocorrelation. To predict the future data, we still need to conduct some test about the original data.

# Slice the data

```{r split_tseries}
cases_ts =
  every_month |> 
  pull(cases_number)|> 
  ts(start = c(2006,1), frequency = 12)

plot(cases_ts,
     main = "Shooting cases per month",
     ylab = "Frequency")

## test model
test_series = cases_ts |> tail(72)

test_series = ts(test_series,start = c(2017,1), frequency = 12)

```

After that, we draw the plot of the original data. It is clear that we can't recognize any upward or downward trend in the time series from the graphs. In order to make the model focused more on recent data points, we decided to reduce the training data. Hence the model would give more weight on the recent data rather than other distant data.

# Conducting the test

## Box Test
$H_{0}$: The data are independently distributed (i.e. the correlations in the population from which the sample is taken are 0, so that any observed correlations in the data result from randomness of the sampling process).

$H_{1}$: The data are not independently distributed; they exhibit serial correlation.

```{r}
Box.test(test_series,type = "Ljung",lag = 6)
```

Then, we need to reject the NULL hypothesis and concluded that the exhibit serial correlation, in other words, this series is not a white noise series and it includes some information which we need. 

After that, we need to conduct Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test to to examine whether the series is a stationary time series or not. If the series is not stationary then the series is to be stabilized by difference.

## Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test

$H_0$:The time series has a unit root, implying that it is non-stationary.

$H_1$:The time series does not have a unit root, implying that it is stationary.

```{r}
aTSA::adf.test(test_series)
```

From the above test result, we can clear in the model of no drift and no trend, all the p-value is greater than the given alpha ($\alpha=0.05$), as a result, we have strong evidence to prove that this series does not have a unit root and concluded that it's a stationary series.


```{r}

acf(cases_ts, lag.max = 20)
pacf(cases_ts)


decomposed = 
  decompose(cases_ts,
            type = "additive") 

plot(decomposed)


```

As the normal time-series prediction procedure requested, we also made the plot of autocorrelation function(ACF) and partial autocorrelation function(PACF) to help us know more about this series. What's more, we decided to decomposed the series by additive method according to the existing feature to this series.

# Grid Research via For Loop

After that, all of us prefer to use the Holtwinter to forecast the series which is a way to model three aspects of the time series: a typical value (average), a slope (trend) over time, and a cyclical repeating pattern (seasonality).

As a result, we need to find out the best parameter for this model. Then, we wrote a function about building a model with different parameters and tried to evaluate the model validity by calculating the root of the mean of the squared errors between the predicted and observed/actual values. 

```{r rmse_function}

holtwinters_rmse = function(alpha, beta, gamma, df) {
    fit = HoltWinters(df, alpha = alpha, beta = beta, gamma = gamma)
    forecast_values = forecast::forecast(fit, h = length(df))
    
    actual_values = as.numeric(df)  
    forecasted_values = as.numeric(forecast_values$mean)
    
    rmse = sqrt(mean((actual_values - forecasted_values)^2, na.rm = TRUE))
    return(rmse)
}

```

## Special Optimization About the Loop

To make it easier, we use the `expand.grid` to list all the possible combinations in a data frame to reduce the loop layers. In this way, we can significantly improve the efficiency of this simulation process.

```{r loop, warning=FALSE}
# Grid search for alpha, beta, and gamma with a step size of 0.1
beta_range = gamma_range = seq(0, 1, 0.1)
alpha_range = seq(.1,1,.1)
param_combin = expand.grid(alpha = alpha_range, beta = beta_range, gamma = gamma_range)

best_params = NULL
best_rmse = Inf

for (i in 1:nrow(param_combin)) {
  
  params = param_combin[i, ]
  rmse = holtwinters_rmse(params$alpha, params$beta, params$gamma, test_series)
  
  if (rmse < best_rmse) {
    best_rmse = rmse
    best_params = params
  }
  
}

# Assuming best_params and best_rmse are your results
print(sprintf("The best parameters of Holtwinters - Alpha: %.2f, Beta: %.2f, Gamma: %.2f",
              best_params$alpha, 
              best_params$beta, 
              best_params$gamma))

print(sprintf("Best RMSE: %.4f",
              best_rmse))

```

# Using the Best Holtwinter Model to Predict

Using the best parameter, we can make the prediction and plot the result.

```{r best_version_prediction, warning=FALSE}

HW_best =  
  HoltWinters(test_series,
              alpha = pull(best_params , alpha),
              beta = pull(best_params , beta),
              gamma = pull(best_params , gamma))

HW_fitted = as.data.frame(fitted(HW_best))

HW_best_forward = 
  forecast(HW_best, h = 12) |> 
  janitor::clean_names()

plot(x= test_series,
     ylab = "Case Number of each month",
     xlim = c(2017,2024),
     ylim = range(0,HW_best_forward$upper[,2]))+
  lines(HW_best$fitted[,1], col = "blue", lty = 2)+
  lines(HW_best_forward$mean,lty=2, col = "red")+
  lines(HW_best_forward$upper[,2],col = "orange")

HW_best_forward |> 
  knitr::kable()
  
```

# Comment

As you can see from the above the graph, the original series is in the color of black. Then, the blue line is the fitted value by Holtwinter modeling. After that, the red line is the predicted value and the orange one is the the 95% upper limit of the prediction.

According to the shape of this prediction, we can clearly know that the case number will drop after September 2023 and peaks at the middle of next year as always. In such circumstance, we suggest that the police station should minimize the likelihood of shootings in the precinct by increasing the number of patrols and the number of patrols conducted.
