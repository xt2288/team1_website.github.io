# Background
  The topic of shooting incidents worldwide raises concerns about the safety and security of various communities. On the afternoon of Nov. 6, 2023, NYU Alert, the alert system of New York University, issued an emergency alert that a shooting had occurred in the Tandon neighborhood, advising people to “run if you can run, hide if you can’t run, and duel if you can’t hide.” This specific case involving an NYU student underscores the need for increased awareness and preventive measures within educational institutions. 


# Motivation
  Shootings in schools are not an isolated problem. It affects the entire school community, and its impact extends beyond the individual case of New York University to include educational institutions and industries throughout the New York area. Beyond the school gates, shootings cast a shadow over the workplace, impacting employee safety and productivity. Shootings instill fear in employees and negatively impact the overall workplace culture. Addressing the root of the problem is critical to maintaining a thriving workforce. Other public spaces and cultural venues are an important part of New York and are not immune to the threat of gun violence. Concert halls, theaters, and recreational areas have all become potential targets. Protecting these spaces requires a collective commitment to implementing safety measures, promoting community engagement, and addressing the social factors that contribute to violence. Overall, the motivation to address these interconnected issues lies in the shared goal of creating safer, more vibrant communities and environments for individuals to thrive.
